Linear regression - best fitting line into our distribution 

Probabilities: put in our linear values input into the sigmoid function

Increment the weights and the bias in the direction of the minimized error - gradient descent 

Learning rate, num_iter = get the changes from the partial derivative expressions 

Recipe:

1. Initialize weights and bias as zero
2. Predict result 
3. Calculate error
4. Use gradient descent to figure out new weight and bias values
